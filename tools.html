                    Wireshark is a tool that is used to intercept the traffic on a network. This is called a packet sniffer, or a network sniffer, and can show you what activity is currently taking place on a network you are connected to. <br>
                    This tool can be useful in many different situations when you want to check out a target network or try to get login information from others.<br>
                    This must always be said, but you Must not use this tool in public or any unauthorized networks, as this is illegal to use on people in public.<br>
                    Do not break the law, Cyber professionals need to uphold the law regarding what they do with the information given to them, and this site does not condone the illegal use of any of the tools listed.<br> 
                    The tool can be used with other means of social engineering to gather information from individuals, that being.<br>
                    If you make a typeo squatting website (a website that is spelled slightly differently then the legit one) such as gooogle instead of google, you can then make that typosquatting website http instead of https.<br>
                    That way when you are using Wireshark, and the target goes to login with their info, they will submit everything in clear text. <br>
                    This can be a good way to trick targets into giving you their info. <br>
                    Wireshark also has some fully legal uses as well, by detecting the traffic on your own network, you will be able to see what is talking to who, and what is taking up the most bandwidth.

                    Wargames is a must watch if you are into Cyber security, or if you enjoy cyber thrillers. <br>
                    The movie has two young highschool students hanging out after school, when one day the main protagonist
                    David Lightman,finds out that there is a new game system out, and he can use his pc terminal to call a
                    bunch
                    of different servers to see if he can access the one that is giving out the game system info.
                    Little did he know, his PC had begun a game with NORADâ€™s Wooper system, that was programmed to play a
                    war
                    game that shows how the cold war with Russia would play out.
                    The pressure comes when the Wooper makes the US think that they are under attack by Russia from their
                    nuclear bombs, along with Russia thinking we will attack them.
